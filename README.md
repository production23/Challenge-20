## Overview of the Analysis

This is a logistic regression model to predict the risk of loan default. The data included financial information such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt. Our goal was to predict whether a loan is healthy (0) or high-risk (1).

## Results

 **Logistic Regression Model:**
   **Accuracy:** 99%
   **Precision:**
    - Healthy loans (0): 1.00
    - High-risk loans (1): 0.86
   **Recall:**
    - Healthy loans (0): 0.99
    - High-risk loans (1): 0.94

## Summary

The logistic regression model performs exceptionally well with an accuracy of 99%. It perfectly predicts healthy loans (precision: 1.00, recall: 0.99) and effectively identifies high-risk loans (precision: 0.86, recall: 0.94). This model is highly reliable and recommended for assessing loan risk.
