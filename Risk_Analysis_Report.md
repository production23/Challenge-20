## Overview of the Analysis

The logistic regression model predicts loan default risk. The data included financial information like loan size, interest rate, borrower income, and debt-to-income ratio. Our goal was to predict whether a loan is healthy (0) or high-risk (1).

## Results

 **Logistic Regression Model:**
   **Accuracy:** 99%
   **Precision:**
    - Healthy loans (0): 1.00
    - High-risk loans (1): 0.86
   **Recall:**
    - Healthy loans (0): 0.99
    - High-risk loans (1): 0.94

## Summary

The logistic regression model performs exceptionally well with 99% accuracy. It accurately predicts healthy loans and effectively identifies high-risk loans.
